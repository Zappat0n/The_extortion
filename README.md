# The Extortion

## About the Project

Game developed in JavaScript using [Phaser 3](https://www.phaser.io/phaser3) game framework.

√ûrymr has stolen Thor's hammer to extort the gods into giving him Freyja as his wife.
Would you travel to J√∂tunheimr and climb the walls of √ötgar√∞ar to help Thor recover his hammer?

Use right and left keyboard keys to move, and mouse left click (or up keyboard key) to jump.

The goal of the game is to climb the walls and collect the coins to get as many points as possible.

You can die in three different ways:
- Falling to the ground.
- Getting hit by a rock thrown by √ûrymr.
- Being bitten by one of √ûrymr's pets.

There is a leaderboard with the 8 top scores.

Make Odin proud and claim your position among the best.

Enjoy the game!
